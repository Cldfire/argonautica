# Overview

[argonautica](https://github.com/bcmyers/argonautica/tree/master/argonautica-py/) is a Python
package for hashing passwords that uses the cryptographically-secure
[argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2) hashing algorithm.

[argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2) won the
[Password Hashing Competition](https://password-hashing.net/) in 2015, a several year project to
identify a successor to [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt),
[scrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt), and other common hashing algorithms.

There are several Python packages that implement argon2, but
[argonautica](https://github.com/bcmyers/argonautica/tree/master/argonautica-py/)
is the only one written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) (as opposed to C or C++).
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) is a \"systems programming language that runs blazingly
fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.\"

AFAIK, [argonautica](https://github.com/bcmyers/argonautica/tree/master/argonautica-py/)
is the only implementation of the argon2 hashing algorithm available in Python that supports
password hashing with secret keys. Not even the
[cannonical C implementation](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2) of argon2 exposes
this feature publicly (it\'s in the code, but unfortunately not accessable via the public API).

Another feature of [argonautica](https://github.com/bcmyers/argonautica/tree/master/argonautica-py/)
is that it uses [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) instructions to peform it\'s hashing
algorithm (if they are available on your CPU), which means it\'s taking full advantage of
modern CPUs to run as fast as possible. The downside is that you have to compile it for
your specific machine (this is why the pip install argonautica process takes a bit of time).

# Requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) version 3.4.0 or higher (or
  [PyPy](http://pypy.org/) version 3.5 or higher)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) version 1.26.0 or higher
- [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) version 3.9.0 or higher

# Installation

- Python:
  - macOS: brew install python3, which requires [Homebrew](<https://brew.sh/)
  - Linux: Use your distribution\'s package manager or follow the instructions
    [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - Windows: Follow the instructions [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Rust:
  - Run the following command in your terminal, then follow the onscreen instructions:
    `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf \| sh`
- LLVM:
  - macOS: `brew install llvm`, which requires [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
  - Debian-based linux: `apt-get install llvm-dev libclang-dev clang`
  - Arch linux: `pacman -S clang`
  - Other linux: Use your distribution\'s package manager
  - Windows: Download a pre-built binary [here](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html)
- argonautica:
  - `pip install argonautica -v` once you have completed the steps above
  - Unfortunately, this step may take several minutes, as
    [argonautica](https://github.com/bcmyers/argonautica/tree/master/argonautica-py/)
    needs to compile it\'s Rust code for your specific CPU (due to its use of SIMD instructions).
    The upside, however, is that once compiled,
    [argonautica](https://github.com/bcmyers/argonautica/tree/master/argonautica-py/)
    should run blazingly fast
  - For those of you who are wondering why
    [argonautica](https://github.com/bcmyers/argonautica/tree/master/argonautica-py/)
    doesn\'t offer pre-compiled wheels like most other native libraries, it\'s precisely
    because of the SIMD instructions. Other native libraries can pre-compile a small number of
    libraries that work pretty much everywhere (e.g. 64bit macOS, 32bit linux, 64bit linux,
    32bit Windows, 64bit Windows), but
    [argonautica](https://github.com/bcmyers/argonautica/tree/master/argonautica-py/)
    compiles code that\'s not just specific to a platform/architecture combination.
    Rather it\'s specific to a platform/architecture/cpu combination; so 64bit macOS code on a
    Haswell processor will be different than 64bit macOS code on a Skylake processor.

# Usage

### Hashing

```{.sourceCode .python3}
from argonautica import Hasher             # or ... from argonautica import Argon2

hasher = Hasher(secret_key='somesecret')   # or ... argon2 = Argon2(secret_key='somesecret')
hash = hasher.hash(password='P@ssw0rd')    # or ... hash = argon2.hash(password='P@ssw0rd')
print(hash)
```

### Verifying

```{.sourceCode .python3}
from argonautica import Verifier              # or ... from argonautica import Argon2

verifier = Verifier(secret_key='somesecret')  # or ... argon2 = Argon2(secret_key='somesecret')
is_valid = verifier.verify(                   # or ... is_valid = argon2.verify(...
    hash='$argon2id$v=19$m=4096,t=128,p=2$c29tZXNhbHQ$WwD2/wGGTuw7u4BW8sLM0Q',
    password='P@ssw0rd',
)
print(is_valid)
```
