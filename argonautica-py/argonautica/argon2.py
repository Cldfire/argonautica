class Argon2:
    """
    A class that knows how to hash and how to verify.

    TODO: Secretkey

    To instantiate it, just invoke it's constructor: ``Argon2()``, which will create
    an ``Argon2`` instance with the following default values:

    * additional_data: ``None``
    * backend: ``Backend.C``
    * hash_length: ``32``
    * iterations: ``192``
    * lanes: ``the number of logical cores on your machine``
    * memory_size: ``4096``
    * salt: ``RandomSalt(32)``
    * secret_key: ``None``
    * threads: ``the number of logical cores on your machine``
    * variant: ``Variant.Argon2id``
    * version: ``Version._0x13``

    You can change any one of these default values by calling the constructor with
    keyword arguments matching the names above, e.g.

    .. code-block:: python

        from argonautica import Argon2

        argon2 = Argon2(iterations=256, secret_key="somesecret")

    or by first instantiating a default ``Argon2`` and then modifying it's properties, e.g.

    .. code-block:: python

        from argonautica import Argon2

        argon2 = Argon2()
        argon2.iterations = 256
        argon2.secret_key = "somesecret"

    Once you have configured a particular ``Argon2`` instance to your liking, you can use
    it to hash by calling the ``hash`` method, e.g.

    .. code-block:: python

        from argonautica import Argon2

        argon2 = Argon2(iterations=256, secret_key="somesecret")
        encoded = argon2.hash("P@ssw0rd")
        print(encoded)

    Once you have a hash, you can use your instance of ``Argon2`` to verify that
    a particular password matches that hash by calling the ``verify`` method, e.g.

    .. code-block:: python

        from argonautica import Argon2

        argon2 = Argon2(iterations=256, secret_key="somesecret")
        encoded = argon2.hash("P@ssw0rd")
        is_valid: bool = argon2.verify(hash=encoded, password="P@ssw0rd")
        print(is_valid)

        can easily figure out the salt that was used to create it, which is fine).

        That said, you have two decisions to make when choosing a salt: 1) The length of the salt
        in bytes, and 2) Whether you want a "random" salt, meaning a salt whose byte buffer
        will be filled with new random bytes before each hash, or a "deterministic" salt,

        is preferred for password hashing and password-based key derivation. Argon2id
        works as Argon2i for the first half of the first iteration over the memory, and
        as Argon2d for the rest, thus providing both side-channel attack protection and
        brute-force cost savings due to time-memory tradeoffs." If you do not know which
