### Overview

`a2` is a Rust crate for hashing passwords using the cryptographically-secure
[Argon2 hashing algorithm](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-argon2-03),
which won the [Password Hashing Competition](https://password-hashing.net/) in 2015 and is
comparable to other secure hashing algorithms such as [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt)
and [scrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt).

`a2` was designed:

* to be easy to use,
* to have robust, beginner-friendly documentation,
* to use sensible defaults, and
* to (as much as possible) follow the [Rust API guidelines](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/api-guidelines/)

The library was built with a simple use-case in mind: hashing passwords for storage in a
website's database. That said, `a2` is also feature-complete, meaning you should be able to
to anything with `a2` that you can do with the cannonical
[C implementation](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2) of Argon2.

### Hashing

Hashing passwords with `a2` is simple. Just instantiate a default
[`Hasher`](struct.Hasher.html), provide it with a password and a secret key, and then
call the [`hash`](struct.Hasher.html#method.hash) method.

```rust
extern crate a2;

fn main() {
    let password = "P@ssw0rd".to_string();
    let secret_key = "\
        secret key that you should really store in \
        an environment variable instead of in code, \
        but this is just an example".to_string();

    let mut hasher = a2::Hasher::default();
    let hash = hasher
        .with_password(password)
        .with_secret_key(secret_key)
        .hash()
        .unwrap();

    println!("{}", &hash);
    // ðŸ‘† prints a hash, which will be random since the default Hasher uses a random salt
}
```

### Verifying

Verifying passwords against a hash is equally as simple. Just instantiate a default
[`Verifier`](struct.Verifier.html), provide it with the password and the hash you would
like to compare, provide it with the secret key that was used to create the hash, and
then call the [`verify`](struct.Verifier.html#method.verify) method.

```rust
extern crate a2;

fn main() {
    let password = "P@ssw0rd".to_string();
    let secret_key = "\
        secret key that you should really store in \
        an environment variable instead of in code, \
        but this is just an example".to_string();

    let mut verifier = a2::Verifier::default();
    let is_valid = verifier
        .with_hash("
            $argon2id$v=19$m=4096,t=128,p=2\
            $IyOw2pHShVfLBeCtdpQbtzLrlL9mxdUhwtMbSqow4u8\
            $w9SjhB3X2Dzbz62eJNqN/FcoHslse27cmGfuxzofHDc
        ")
        .with_password(password)
        .with_secret_key(secret_key)
        .verify()
        .unwrap();

    assert!(is_valid);
}
```

### Configuration

The default configurations for [`Hasher`](struct.Hasher.html) and
[`Verifier`](struct.Verifier.html) were chosen to be reasonably secure for the general
use-case of hashing passwords for storage in a website database, but if you want to use
`a2` for different reasons or if you just disagree with the chosen defaults, customizing
`a2` to meet your needs should hopefully be as easy and as intuitive as using the defaults.

Here is an example that shows how to use [`Hasher`](struct.Hasher.html)'s custom
configuration options. It provides color on each of the options.

```rust
extern crate a2;
extern crate futures_cpupool;

use a2::config::{Backend, Variant, Version};
use futures_cpupool::CpuPool;

fn main() {
    let mut hasher = a2::Hasher::default();
    hasher
        .configure_backend(Backend::C) // Default is `Backend::C`
        // ðŸ‘† a2 was designed to support multiple backends (meaning multiple implementations
        // of the underlying Argon2 algorithm). Currently only the C backend is supported,
        // which uses the cannonical Argon2 library written in C to actually do the work.
        // In the future hopefully a Rust backend will also be supported, but, for the
        // moment, you must use Backend::C, which is the default. Using Backend::Rust will
        // result in an error (again, for the moment).
        .configure_cpu_pool(CpuPool::new(2)) // See below for description of default
        // ðŸ‘† There are two non-blocking methods on `Hasher` that perform computation on
        // a separate thread and return a `Future` instead of a `Result` (`hash_non_blocking`
        // and `hash_raw_non_blocking`). These methods allows `a2` to play nice with
        // futures-heavy code, but need a `CpuPool` in order to work. The blocking
        // methods `hash` and `hash_raw` do not use a 'CpuPool'; so if you are using only
        // these blocking methods you can ignore this configuration entirely. If, however,
        // you are using the non-blocking methods and would like to provide your own `CpuPool`
        // instead of using the default, which is a lazily created `CpuPool` with the number
        // of threads equal to the number of logical cores on your machine, you can
        // configure your `Hasher` with a custom `CpuPool` using this method. This
        // might be useful if, for example, you are writing code in an environment which
        // makes heavy use of futures, the code you are writing uses both a `Hasher` and
        // a `Verifier`, and you would like both of them to share the same underlying
        // `CpuPool`.
        .configure_hash_length(32) // Default is `32`
        // ðŸ‘† The hash length in bytes is configurable. The default is 32. This is probably
        // a good number to use. 16 is also probably fine. You probably shouldn't go below 16
        .configure_iterations(128) // Default is `128`
        // ðŸ‘† Argon2 has a notion of "iterations" or "time cost". All else equal and generally
        // speaking, the greater the number of iterations, the longer it takes to perform the
        // hash and the more secure the resulting hash. More iterations basically means more
        // CPU load. This and "memory size" (see below) are the two primary parameters to
        // adjust in order to increase or decrease the security of your hash. The default is
        // 128 iterations, which was chosen because, along with the default memory size of
        // 4096, this leads to a hashing time of approximately 500 milliseconds on the
        // early-2014 Macbook Air that is the developer's machine. If you're going to use
        // a2 in production, you should probably tweak this parameter (and the memory size
        // parameter) in order to increase the time it takes to hash to the maximum you can
        // reasonably allow for your use-case (e.g. to probably about 500 milliseconds
        // for the use-case of hashing user passwords for a website)
        .configure_lanes(2) // Default is number of physical cores on your machine
        // ðŸ‘† Argon2 can break up its work into one or more "lanes" during some parts of
        // the hashing algorithm. If you configure it with multiple lanes and you also
        // use multiple threads (see below) the hashing algorithm will performed its
        // work in parallel in some parts, potentially speeding up the time it takes to
        // produce a hash without diminishing the security of the result. By default,
        // the number of lanes is set to the number of physical cores on your machine
        .configure_memory_size(4096) // Default is `4096`
        // ðŸ‘† Argon2 has a notion of "memory size" or "memory cost" (in kibibytes). All else
        // equal and generally speaking, the greater the memory size, the longer it takes to
        // perform the hash and the more secure the resulting hash. More memory size basically
        // means more memory used. This and "iterations" (see above) are, again, generally
        // speaking, the two parameters to adjust in order to increase or decrease the
        // security of your hash. The default is 4096 kibibytes, which was chosen because,
        // again, along with the default iterations of 128, this leads to a hashing time of
        // approximately 500 milliseconds on the early-2014 Macbook Air that is the
        // developer's machine. If you're going to use a2 in production, you should probably
        // tweak this parameter (and the iterations parameter) in order to increase the time
        // it takes to hash to the maximum you can reasonably allow for your use-case
        // (e.g. to probably about 500 milliseconds for the use-case of hashing user passwords
        // for a website)
        .configure_password_clearing(false) // Default is `true`
        // ðŸ‘† By default, every time you call hash or hash_raw on a Hasher, the underying
        // bytes of the password you provided are completely erased, meaning you can no
        // longer access them and will have to provide a new password to Hasher in order
        // to call hash or hash_raw again. This is a security measure designed to
        // to prevent you from keeping the password bytes around for longer than you have to.
        // This means that when "password clearing" is set to `true`, you will *not* be able
        // to use Hasher if you provided it with a borrowed (as opposed to owned) password
        // Hasher cannot erase the bytes of a value it does not own. If you pass Hasher a
        // borrowed password with "password clearing" set to `true` and try to call hash
        // or hash_raw, they will return a `PasswordUnownedError`. Using the above
        // configuration method, however, you can turn this security feature off by passing
        // `false`. This is not recommended. See the documentation for the `Password` type
        // in the `data` module for more details
        .configure_secret_key_clearing(false) // Default is `false`
        // ðŸ‘† It is also possible to have the underlying bytes of the secret key you provided
        // to a Hasher be erased after each call to hash or hash_raw. Unlike with
        // password clearing, however, this option is turned off by default. Typically,
        // you'll want to use the same Hasher instance to hash multiple passwords. With
        // the default setting of secret key clearing set to `false`, you can provide your
        // Hasher with your secret key once and use it for multiple passwords. If you want
        // to be extra secure and force yourself to provide the secret key to Hasher every
        // time you hash a password, you can turn this feature on by passing `true` to this
        // method, but if you do so you can only give Hasher an owned (as opposed to borrowed)
        // secret key value, otherwise calling the hash or hash_raw methods will return a
        // `SecretKeyUnownedError`. See the documentation for the `SecretKey` type in the
        // `data` module for more details
        .configure_threads(2) // Default is number of physical cores on your machine
        // ðŸ‘† If you have configured a Hasher to use more than one lane (see above), you
        // can get the hashing algorithm to run in parallel during some parts of the
        // computation by setting the number of threads to be greater than one as well,
        // potentially speeding up the time it takes to produce a hash without diminishing
        // the security of the result. By default, the number of threads is set to the number
        // of physical cores on your machine
        .configure_variant(Variant::Argon2id) // Default is `Variant::Argon2id`
        // ðŸ‘† Argon2 has three variants: Argon2d, Argon2i, and Argon2id. Here is how these
        // variants are explained in the RFC: "Argon2 has one primary variant: Argon2id,
        // and two supplementary variants: Argon2d and Argon2i. Argon2d uses data-dependent
        // memory access, which makes it suitable for ... applications with no threats from
        // side-channel timing attacks. Argon2i uses data-independent memory access, which
        // is preferred for password hashing and password-based key derivation. Argon2id
        // works as Argon2i for the first half of the first iteration over the memory, and
        // as Argon2d for the rest, thus providing both side-channel attack protection and
        // brute-force cost savings due to time-memory tradeoffs." If you do not know which
        // variant to use, use the default, which is Argon2id
        .configure_version(Version::_0x13) // Default is `Version::_0x13`
        // ðŸ‘† Argon2 has two versions: 0x10 and 0x13. The latest version is 0x13 (as of 5/18).
        // Unless you have a very specific reason not to, you should use the latest
        // version (0x13), which is also the default
        .opt_out_of_random_salt(true) // Default is `false`
        // ðŸ‘† As a built-in "safety" mechanism, if you wish to use a non-random salt,
        // which is generally not a good idea, you must explicity call this method
        // with `true` in order to allow it
        .opt_out_of_secret_key(true); // Default is `false`
        // ðŸ‘† As a built-in "safety" mechanism, if you wish to hash without a secret key,
        // which is generally not a good idea, you must explicity call this method
        // with `true` in order to allow it

    let hash = hasher
        .with_password("P@ssw0rd")
        // ðŸ‘† OK to pass a borrowed value because we set "password clearing" to `false`
        .with_salt("somesalt")
        // ðŸ‘† A non-random salt, which is a bad idea, but possible
        // because we configured this Hasher with `opt_out_of_random_salt(true)`
        .hash()
        // ðŸ‘† Notice we did not include a secret key, which is also a bad idea, but possible
        // because we configured this Hasher with opt_out_of_secret_key(true)
        .unwrap();

    println!("{}", &hash);
    // ðŸ‘† prints $argon2id$v=19$m=4096,t=128,p=2$c29tZXNhbHQ$WwD2/wGGTuw7u4BW8sLM0Q
}
```

### Installation

`a2` should be relatively straightforward to include in your Rust project:

* Place `extern crate a2;` in your code (typically in either `lib.rs` or `main.rs`)
* Place the following in the `[dependencies]` section of your `Cargo.toml`:
  * `a2 = "0.1.0"`, or
  * `a2 = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["serde"] }`</br>
    (The optional serde feature allows you to serialize / deserialize structs and
    enums from `a2` using the [serde](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde) ecosystem).

That said, `a2` uses [cc](https://github.com/alexcrichton/cc-rs) and
[bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen) to compile the cannonical
[C implemenation](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2) of Argon2 into a
static archive during the build process. This means you need a C compiler on your
machine in order to build `a2`. More specifically, you need:

* [LLVM/Clang](https://llvm.org/) (version 3.9 or higher)
  * Mac OS: `brew install llvm`, which requires [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
  * Debian-based linux: `apt-get install llvm-[version]-dev libclang-[version]-dev clang-[version]`
  * Arch linux: `pacman -S clang`
  * Windows: Download a pre-built binary [here](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html)

`a2` runs on stable Rust version 1.26.0 or greater.

### Alternatives

If `a2` isn't your cup of tea, other Rust crates that will do Argon2 hashing for you
include [argon2rs](https://github.com/bryant/argon2rs) and
[rust-argon2](https://github.com/sru-systems/rust-argon2). As already mentioned, there's
also a cannonical [C implementation](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2), which `a2`
actually uses under the hood if you're using the C backend. Finally, if you're interesting
in password hashing with a different algorithm,
[rust-bcrypt](https://github.com/Keats/rust-bcrypt) might be worth checking out.

For what it's worth, besides API differences, `a2` has three features that other
Rust crates currently do not:

* `a2` uses [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) instructions by default if your
  processor has access to them, which can lead to significantly faster hashing times than
  implementations that do not take advantage of [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD)
  _ For example, on default settings, `a2` runs ~30% faster than other Rust crates on the
  developer's early-2014 Macbook, which has access to
  [SIMD instructions](https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/)
  through
  [AVX1.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions#Advanced_Vector_Extensions)
  _ <i>Note: If for some reason you would like to turn SIMD off, compile with the
  </i>`without_simd`<i> feature enabled</i>
* `a2` is the only Rust crate that implements the newest Argon2 variant: Argon2id
* `a2` has the ability to create hashes with a secret key, which not even the
  [C implementation](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2) exposes publicly
  (for string encoded hashes at least)
