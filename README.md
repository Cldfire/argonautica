### Overview

<b>jasonus</b> is a Rust crate for hashing passwords using the cryptographically-secure
[Argon2 hashing algorithm](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-argon2-03),
which won the [Password Hashing Competition](https://password-hashing.net/) in 2015 and is
comparable to other secure hashing algorithms such as [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt)
and [scrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt).

<b>jasonus</b> was designed:
* to be easy to use,
* to have robust, beginner-friendly documentation, and
* to (as much as possible) follow the [Rust API guidelines](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/api-guidelines/)

<b>jasonus</b> was built with a simple use-case in mind: hashing passwords for storage in a
website's database. That said, <b>jasonus</b> is <u>"feature-complete"</u>, meaning anything you can
do with the cannonical [C implementation](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2) of
Argon2 you should able to do with <b>jasonus</b>.

<i>\* Indeed, jasonus even has a feature that even the cannonical C implementation currently lacks,
namely hashing with secret keys (the C implementation implements this, but doesn't expose it
publicly)</i>

### Hashing

Hashing passwords with <b>jasonus</b> is simple.  Just instantiate a default
[`Hasher`](struct.Hasher.html), provide it with a password and a secret key, and then
call the [`hash`](struct.Hasher.html#method.hash) method.
```rust
extern crate jasonus;

use jasonus::Hasher;

fn main() {
    let mut hasher = Hasher::default();
    let hash = hasher
        .with_password("P@ssw0rd")
        .with_secret_key("\
            secret key that you should really store in \
            an environment variable instead of in code, \
            but this is just an example\
        ")
        .hash()
        .unwrap();

    println!("{}", &hash);
    // ðŸ‘† prints a hash, which will be random since the default Hasher uses a random salt
}
```
### Verifying

Verifying passwords against a hash is equally as simple. Just instantiate a default
[`Verifier`](struct.Verifier.html), provide it with the password and the hash you would
like to compare, provide it with the secret key that was used to create the hash, and
then call the [`verify`](struct.Verifier.html#method.verify) method.
```rust
extern crate jasonus;

use jasonus::Verifier;

fn main() {
    let mut verifier = Verifier::default();
    let is_valid = verifier
        .with_hash("
            $argon2id$v=19$m=4096,t=128,p=2$\
            539gu1a/qkTRCHKPuECV7jcRgWH/hRDjxidNdQJ7cKs$\
            On6oPYf4jttaWb4kRCyyffDVYkBF+R4cEBl8WADZhw0\
        ")
        .with_password("P@ssw0rd")
        .with_secret_key("\
            secret key that you should really store in \
            an environment variable instead of in code, \
            but this is just an example\
        ")
        .verify()
        .unwrap();

    assert!(is_valid);
}
```
### Alternatives

If <b>jasonus</b> isn't your cup of tea, other Rust crates that will do Argon2 hashing for you
include [argon2rs](https://github.com/bryant/argon2rs) and
[rust-argon2](https://github.com/sru-systems/rust-argon2). If you're interesting
in password hashing with a different algorithm,
[rust-bcrypt](https://github.com/Keats/rust-bcrypt) might be worth checking out.

For what it's worth, besides API differences, <b>jasonus</b> has three key features that other
Rust crates currently do not:
* <b>jasonus</b> has the ability to create hashes with a secret key, which not even the
  [C implementation](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2) exposes publicly
* <b>jasonus</b> is the only Rust crate that implements the newest Argon2 variant: Argon2id
* <b>jasonus</b> uses [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) instructions by default if your
  processor has access to them, which can lead to significantly faster hashing times
    * For example, on default settings, <b>jasonus</b> runs ~30% faster than other Rust crates on the
      developer's early-2014 Macbook, which has access to
      [SIMD instructions](https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/)
      through
      [AVX1.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions#Advanced_Vector_Extensions)
    * <i>Note: If for some reason you would like to turn SIMD off, compile with the
      </i>`without_simd`<i> feature enabled, which will be necessary if you're compiling
      for machines other than your own</i>
    * <i>Further note: [argon2rs](https://github.com/bryant/argon2rs) has a
      [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) feature as well, but it's currently
      available on nightly Rust only</i>

### Configuration

The default configurations for [`Hasher`](struct.Hasher.html) and
[`Verifier`](struct.Verifier.html) were chosen to be reasonably secure for the general
use-case of hashing passwords for storage in a website database, but if you want to use
<b>jasonus</b> for different reasons or if you just disagree with the chosen defaults, customizing
<b>jasonus</b> to meet your needs should hopefully be as easy and as intuitive as using the defaults.

Here is an example that shows how to use [`Hasher`](struct.Hasher.html)'s custom
configuration options. It provides color on each of the options.
```rust
extern crate jasonus;
extern crate futures_cpupool;

use jasonus::Hasher;
use jasonus::config::{Backend, Variant, Version};
use futures_cpupool::CpuPool;

fn main() {
    let mut hasher = Hasher::default();
    hasher
        .configure_backend(Backend::C) // Default is `Backend::C`
        // ðŸ‘† jasonus was designed to support multiple backends (meaning multiple implementations
        // of the underlying Argon2 algorithm). Currently only the C backend is supported,
        // which uses the cannonical Argon2 library written in C to actually do the work.
        // In the future hopefully a Rust backend will also be supported, but, for the
        // moment, you must use `Backend::C`, which is the default. Using `Backend::Rust` will
        // result in an error (again, for the moment).
        .configure_cpu_pool(CpuPool::new(2))
        // ðŸ‘† There are two non-blocking methods on `Hasher` that perform computation on
        // a separate thread and return a `Future` instead of a `Result` (`hash_non_blocking`
        // and `hash_raw_non_blocking`). These methods allow jasonus to play nicely with
        // futures-heavy code, but need a `CpuPool` in order to work. The blocking
        // methods `hash` and `hash_raw` do not use a 'CpuPool'; so if you are using only
        // these blocking methods you can ignore this configuration entirely. If, however,
        // you are using the non-blocking methods and would like to provide your own `CpuPool`
        // instead of using the default, which is a lazily created `CpuPool` with the number
        // of threads equal to the number of logical cores on your machine, you can
        // configure your `Hasher` with a custom `CpuPool` using this method. This
        // might be useful if, for example, you are writing code in an environment which
        // makes heavy use of futures, the code you are writing uses both a `Hasher` and
        // a `Verifier`, and you would like both of them to share the same underlying
        // `CpuPool`.
        .configure_hash_length(32) // Default is `32`
        // ðŸ‘† The hash length in bytes is configurable. The default is 32. This is probably
        // a good number to use. 16 is also probably fine. You probably shouldn't go below 16
        .configure_iterations(128) // Default is `128`
        // ðŸ‘† Argon2 has a notion of "iterations" or "time cost". All else equal and generally
        // speaking, the greater the number of iterations, the longer it takes to perform the
        // hash and the more secure the resulting hash. More iterations basically means more
        // CPU load. This and "memory size" (see below) are the two primary parameters to
        // adjust in order to increase or decrease the security of your hash. The default is
        // 128 iterations, which was chosen because, along with the default memory size of
        // 4096, this leads to a hashing time of approximately 500 milliseconds on the
        // early-2014 Macbook Air that is the developer's machine. If you're going to use
        // jasonus in production, you should probably tweak this parameter (and the memory size
        // parameter) in order to increase the time it takes to hash to the maximum you can
        // reasonably allow for your use-case (e.g. to probably about 500 milliseconds
        // for the use-case of hashing user passwords for a website)
        .configure_lanes(2) // Default is number of logical cores on your machine
        // ðŸ‘† Argon2 can break up its work into one or more "lanes" during some parts of
        // the hashing algorithm. If you configure it with multiple lanes and you also
        // use multiple threads (see below) the hashing algorithm will performed its
        // work in parallel in some parts, potentially speeding up the time it takes to
        // produce a hash without diminishing the security of the result. By default,
        // the number of lanes is set to the number of logical cores on your machine
        .configure_memory_size(4096) // Default is `4096`
        // ðŸ‘† Argon2 has a notion of "memory size" or "memory cost" (in kibibytes). All else
        // equal and generally speaking, the greater the memory size, the longer it takes to
        // perform the hash and the more secure the resulting hash. More memory size basically
        // means more memory used. This and "iterations" (see above) are, again, generally
        // speaking, the two parameters to adjust in order to increase or decrease the
        // security of your hash. The default is 4096 kibibytes, which was chosen because,
        // again, along with the default iterations of 128, this leads to a hashing time of
        // approximately 500 milliseconds on the early-2014 Macbook Air that is the
        // developer's machine. If you're going to use jasonus in production, you should probably
        // tweak this parameter (and the iterations parameter) in order to increase the time
        // it takes to hash to the maximum you can reasonably allow for your use-case
        // (e.g. to probably about 500 milliseconds for the use-case of hashing user passwords
        // for a website)
        .configure_password_clearing(false) // Default is `false`
        // ðŸ‘† It is possible to have the underlying bytes of the password you provided
        // to `Hasher` be erased after each call to `hash`, `hash_raw` or their non-blocking
        // equivalents. If you want this extra security feature, set this configuration
        // to `true` (the default is `false`). If you set this configuration to `true`,
        // you will be required to provide `Hasher` with an owned password (e.g.
        // a `String` or a `Vec<u8>` instead of a `&str` or a `&[u8]`), since the only way
        // `Hasher` can ensure all the underlying bytes of the password are indeed
        // erased is to own the data
        .configure_secret_key_clearing(false) // Default is `false`
        // ðŸ‘† It is also possible to have the underlying bytes of the secret key you provided
        // to `Hasher` be erased after each call to `hash`, `hash_raw` or their non-blocking
        // equivalents. If you want this extra security feature, set this configuration
        // to `true` (the default is `false`). If you set this configuration to `true`,
        // you will be required to provide `Hasher` with an owned secret key (e.g.
        // a `String` or a `Vec<u8>` instead of a `&str` or a `&[u8]`), since the only way
        // `Hasher` can ensure all the underlying bytes of the secret key are indeed
        // erased is to own the data
        .configure_threads(2) // Default is number of logical cores on your machine
        // ðŸ‘† If you have configured `Hasher` to use more than one lane (see above), you
        // can get the hashing algorithm to run in parallel during some parts of the
        // computation by setting the number of threads to be greater than one as well,
        // potentially speeding up the time it takes to produce a hash without diminishing
        // the security of the result. By default, the number of threads is set to the number
        // of logical cores on your machine. If you set the number of threads to a number
        // greater than the number of lanes, `Hasher` will automatically reduce the number
        // of threads to the number of lanes
        .configure_variant(Variant::Argon2id) // Default is `Variant::Argon2id`
        // ðŸ‘† Argon2 has three variants: Argon2d, Argon2i, and Argon2id. Here is how these
        // variants are explained in the RFC: "Argon2 has one primary variant: Argon2id,
        // and two supplementary variants: Argon2d and Argon2i. Argon2d uses data-dependent
        // memory access, which makes it suitable for ... applications with no threats from
        // side-channel timing attacks. Argon2i uses data-independent memory access, which
        // is preferred for password hashing and password-based key derivation. Argon2id
        // works as Argon2i for the first half of the first iteration over the memory, and
        // as Argon2d for the rest, thus providing both side-channel attack protection and
        // brute-force cost savings due to time-memory tradeoffs." If you do not know which
        // variant to use, use the default, which is Argon2id
        .configure_version(Version::_0x13) // Default is `Version::_0x13`
        // ðŸ‘† Argon2 has two versions: 0x10 and 0x13. The latest version is 0x13 (as of 5/18).
        // Unless you have a very specific reason not to, you should use the latest
        // version (0x13), which is also the default
        .opt_out_of_random_salt(true) // Default is `false`
        // ðŸ‘† As a built-in security mechanism, if you wish to use a non-random salt,
        // which is generally not a good idea, you must explicity call this method
        // with `true` in order to allow it
        .opt_out_of_secret_key(true); // Default is `false`
        // ðŸ‘† As a built-in security mechanism, if you wish to hash without a secret key,
        // which is generally not a good idea, you must explicity call this method
        // with `true` in order to allow it

    let hash = hasher
        .with_password("P@ssw0rd")
        .with_salt("somesalt")
        // ðŸ‘† A non-random salt, which is a bad idea, but possible because we configured
        // `Hasher` with `opt_out_of_random_salt(true)`
        .hash()
        // ðŸ‘† Notice we did not include a secret key, which is also a bad idea, but possible

```
### Installation

<b>jasonus</b> should be relatively straightforward to include in your Rust project:
* Place `extern crate jasonus;` in your code (typically in either `lib.rs` or `main.rs`)
* Place the following in the `[dependencies]` section of your `Cargo.toml`:
    * `jasonus = "0.1.0"`, or
    * `jasonus = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["serde"] }`</br>
    (The optional serde feature allows you to serialize / deserialize structs and
    enums from <b>jasonus</b> using the [serde](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde) ecosystem).

That said, <b>jasonus</b> uses [cc](https://github.com/alexcrichton/cc-rs) and
[bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen) to compile the cannonical
[C implemenation](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2) of Argon2 into a
static archive during the build process. This means you need a C compiler on your
machine in order to build <b>jasonus</b>. More specifically, you need:
* [LLVM/Clang](https://llvm.org/) (version 3.9 or higher)
    * Mac OS: `brew install llvm`, which requires [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
    * Debian-based linux: `apt-get install llvm-[version]-dev libclang-[version]-dev clang-[version]`
    * Arch linux: `pacman -S clang`
    * Windows: Download a pre-built binary [here](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html)

<b>jasonus</b> runs on stable Rust version 1.26.0 or greater.
