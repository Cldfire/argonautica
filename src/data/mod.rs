//! Structs representing data to hash (i.e. `Password`, `Salt`, `SecretKey`, and `AdditionalData`)
//!
//! All the stucts below can be constructed from `Vec<u8>`, `&[u8]`, `String`, `&str`, as well as
//! other types, as they all implement several versions of the `From` trait. Some have additional
//! constructors as well, e.g. `Salt::random(...)`, which produces a `Salt` that will create new
//! crytographically-secure, random bytes after each call to `Hasher::hash()` or `Hasher::hash_raw()`.
//!
//! Additionall, all the structs below implement the `Serialize` and `Deserialize` traits from `serde`,
//! although `Password` and `SecretKey` will serialize into empty bytes for security reasons.
//!
//! Finally, each struct below implements the `Data` trait, which provides read-only access to
//! the otherwise opaque struct's underlying bytes.
